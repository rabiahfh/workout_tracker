 ## Description 
  
or this assignment, I created a workout tracker that required me to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
The user, will be able to view create and track daily workouts. In addition, to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled. This will enable a consumer to reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

How do you deliver this?:

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
